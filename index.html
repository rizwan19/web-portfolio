                I already learned basic HTML and CSS. I can build any simple website.
                I can even teach others how to make a simple website. My goal is to learn
                more about building websites more efficiently.

                to make a website function efficient. I didn't stop with the web.

                know the deployment, server and security. I will give you 100% web

                They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a excellent web
                developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They liked 
                it and uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
